# python-apis-consuming-III

## Using the Python requests module

In this exercise, you will learn to call advanced APIs with query parameters to call specific data, and see the patterns in such sort of information retrieval. 

In the lectures, you have learnt about query parameters. Here we will look at a more complex set of APIs with larger amount of data, a larger JSON structure, and will use query params to call specific information for this data.

The API you will be calling is called the [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/en). Faker Faker API is a collection of completely free APIs that helps web developers and web designers generate fake data in a fast and easy way. No registration is required. No tokens, no authentication.

#### Exercise Instructions

0. Go to [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/en) website and read the short description on how to use the API. **Make sure you understand how the queries work**

Use the python requests module to query the API for the following:

1. Make GET call to get some companies. 
2. Make GET call to get 50 persons with English names who were born after 1994.
